üí° **Green call-out boxes** denote recommendations from Team Leads

</aside>

### **Pre-Program**

**Develop the Idea**

Before the program starts, team leads should think of a research question they want to study. They can do so either independently, or in consultation with a faculty advisor who they either reach out to independently or the program connects them with. Team leads should provide the program administrator with a short line or title of the project to use to recruit students.

<aside>
üí° Talk to a faculty advisor - whether one you have connected with through the MAvERICS Program or your PI - early on in the process. They have a lot of experience and can help you shape questions that will be easier to get published if you end up pursuing the project to publication.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° In choosing a project, try to approach your area of interest from a position of inquiry and not criticism. The more critical the approach - the more challenging it will be to share the study results.

</aside>

**Prepare Articles Database and Data Dictionary for Screening** 

CVI administrative staff, with guidance from Lane Library staff, will work with each team to establish the following resources for their group:

- A googlesheet that includes at least 3 worksheets:
    1. Screening Database - usually each row is an article and each column represents a criteria that is being screened for. When thinking about which articles should populate the database, teams should consider which journals they want to survey, over what period of time, and try to be as specific as possible.
    2. Data Dictionary - definitions of each criteria being screened for that will guide the screening process. The dictionary will be iteratively refined during the first few weeks of the program. It is helpful to also specify a ‚Äòformatting guide‚Äô (e.g. use 1 instead of ‚Äòyes‚Äô or a checkmark.)
    3. Decision Log - a list of important decisions that are made by the group that everyone can refer back to. Each row, or decision, should include the date, the person recording the decision, and the decision itself.
- A googledoc that is the working draft of the pre-registration

<aside>
üìå By the time the program starts on June 1st, team leads should have an idea of their research question, a database of articles to screen, and a data dictionary to guide the screening process.

</aside>

### **Week 1**

**During the Meeting**

1. Team introductions: With the team lead going last, go around the group and introduce everyone‚Äôs, background and previous training, the lab they‚Äôre currently working in, and why they‚Äôre interested in this topic.
2. Team lead introduces the project and the project timeline
    - Why this topic is important - and why they think it‚Äôs cool
    - An approximate timeline of what the next 10 weeks will look like
    - How the project could continue and how authorship would work if the team tries to pursue a paper (see F.A.Q. below)
    - The responsibilities of everyone on the team:
        - Students - screening, thinking about the problem, asking questions as they arise, drafting sections of the preregistration
        - Lead - setting deadlines, checking screening, helping resolve ambiguities with the screening, synthesizing the draft into final pre-registration
3. Team lead gives a tour of the screening database, the data dictionary, and the decision log
4. Team Lead demos screening 1 article and filling in the database.

**Tasks for Week 2**

1. Each student screens 5 articles, filling in the database as they do so.
2. Students should keep track of questions they have during screening and ideas they have for additional questions

<aside>
üí° Team leads should also expect to spend about 3-5 hours a week on the project during the 10-week program.

</aside>

1. If applicable, team leads should schedule a meeting with their faculty advisor.

### **Week 2**

**During the Meeting**

1. Discuss the [options for pre-registration, and public protocols](MAvERICS%20Roadmap%20e8ea0e314fc7409b96d75fe396c46551/Sharing%20Protocols%20a5a32f0cf173485cb9c7fa310e91cd3f.md) and see which option people are leaning towards. Remind students that the final decision to create a pre-registration or a public protocol can be made at the end of the program - the content is the same for both.
2. Team lead should introduce the shared protocol document (GoogleDoc) and explain how each student will put their drafts for each section into the document
3. At least two students each live-screen an article. The team should address questions as they come up and update the decision log as needed.
4. Discuss any outstanding questions or ideas that students had during the week. Update the data dictionary and decision log as needed.

<aside>
üí° Start with a hypothesis, but allow for some modification and/or secondary hypotheses when discussing your research question with the students.

</aside>

**Tasks for Week 3**

1. Each student should screen 10 articles and make a note of any questions or ideas they have for discussion. Questions can also be put in the shared slack channel.
2. If they plan to use OSF, the team lead should create an OSF project for the study and fill in the summary, contributors, and other information. Find out more about [setting up OSF for sharing a protocol](MAvERICS%20Roadmap%20e8ea0e314fc7409b96d75fe396c46551/Sharing%20Protocols%20a5a32f0cf173485cb9c7fa310e91cd3f.md).
3. All students come up with a 7-15 word title for the project and record it in the shared protocol document.

### **Week 3**

**During the Meeting**

1. The students on the team who have not yet live-screened an article should do so. The team should address questions as they come up and update the decision log as needed.
2. Discuss any outstanding questions or ideas that students had during the week. Update the data dictionary and decision log as needed.
3. Team lead synthesizes the draft titles the students created during the week into a single working title.
4. Team lead walks through and explains the ‚ÄúStudy Information‚Äù section of the protocol.

**Tasks for Week 4**

1. Students should, combined, screen 1/4th of the articles - as screener 1
2. Students should each draft the Study Information section of a protocol and copy it into the shared Protocol document.

<aside>
üí° The students should appreciate that they should be doing the heavy lifting of the screening. The time of the team lead should be spent making sure that the students can screen correctly.

</aside>

1. Team Leads should review 2-3 articles screened by each student to ensure the screening is accurate.

<aside>
üìå After the week 3 meeting, teams should have finished refining the data dictionary and be prepared to start screening in earnest.

</aside>

### **Week 4**

**During the Meeting**

1. Team lead synthesizes the Study Information everyone wrote into one, combined, working version.
2. Discuss how you will decide authorship order for the protocol and, if applicable, the OSF project.
3. Update the decision diary and data dictionary as needed as more unusual screening circumstances appear.
4. Walk through the Design Plan section of the protocol so students are oriented to it.

**Tasks for Week 5**

1. Students should, combined, screen the 2nd 1/4th of articles as screener 1.
2. Team Leads should continue to review 2-3 articles from each student to ensure the screening is accurate
3. Students should all draft a Design Plan and copy it into the main protocol document.

<aside>
üí° Team leads should expect there to be some variability in the students‚Äô contributions. Because team leads are not giving students a grade or other reward, it can be hard to motivate the students with conflicting responsibilities. Team leads may act more like a cheerleader than an overseer. It can be hard to find the right balance between micromanaging the students and giving them too much free reign - to help them be productive without being too pushy.

</aside>

### **Week 5**

**During the Meeting**

1. Team lead synthesizes the Design Plans everyone wrote into one, combined, version. Resolve confusion/ambiguities where they arise.

## F.A.Q.

- **Do I have to make a database for screening from scratch? Can‚Äôt I just use existing data?**
    
    Team leads can choose to either create a new list of articles to screen, or re-use a list (database) of articles from a previous project.
    
- **What if the project is going slower than the roadmap?**
    
    That‚Äôs cool! Instead of trying to complete *both* a public protocol *and* a database; just focus your efforts on one. Another group could build off the work next year.
    
- **How should we decide author listing for the public protocol or pre-registration?**
    
    There are many options. Any of these options is reasonable as long as all of the group agrees to it. If all students contributions are equal you could have co-authors and note that several individuals contributed equally. There is no reason you can‚Äôt have 4 equally-contributing co-authors. To decide who is listed fist, you can:
    
    - Assign each student a number and use a random number generator to pick the order
    - List contributors alphabetically
    
    Note that if you are using OSF, there are two opportunities for author listings: the public protocol or pre-registration, *and* the OSF project.
    
    If student contributions are not equal, it is traditional to have authors who contributed more listed first. 
    
- **As a team lead, should I try to work with my PI or someone the program sets me up with as a faculty advisor?**
    
    Having an advisor who you know and are familiar with is great because you have an established relationship and shared knowledge base. Having an advisor who you don‚Äôt know as well is *also* great because it‚Äôs a chance to connect with a PI outside your immediate group and expand your network.
    
- **We want to keep working on our study and try to publish it after the program is over. How should we decide authorship?**
    
    A major decision in how you handle authorship for a pursuant publication will depend on the team lead‚Äôs career stage and comfort level, as well as the contributions of the team. An early graduate or medical student team lead will probably seek first authorship, with the undergraduate students in the team listed co-authors, and with an advising faculty member as senior author. A postdoc with a very mature or enterprising team of students might choose to be senior author with one or more of the team‚Äôs students as first author.
    
- **Where can students or teams present their work?**
    
    Students are encouraged to present their work at conferences in their field - such as the AHA annual conference.
    Some specialist conferences for metascience and open research practices may also be suitable:
    [- Research 2 Reader Conference](https://r2rconf.com/)
    [- PUBMET](https://pubmet2022.unizd.hr/)
    [- AIMOS](https://aimos.community/)
