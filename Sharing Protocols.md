# Sharing Protocols

There are several ways you can choose to share your protocol - or study plan. 

## **Sharing as Pre-Registration**

<aside>
➕ **Pros:** This is the most ‘official’-looking of the options; also the pre-registration will be associated with it’s own, referencable, DOI.

</aside>

<aside>
➖ **Cons:** Represents a commitment to follow-through with the study. If a study has been pre-registered, someone may approach the authors and ask about the status of the study. If students later decide they do not want to be associated with the project, the pre-registration cannot as easily be taken down.

1. Create an OSF account on [http://osf.io/](http://osf.io/)
2. Ask your team to all join OSF and tell you their names.
3. Create a new project.
4. Click on the Preregistration tab at the top of the page.
5. Start a new preregistration, using the OSF template.
6. Invite your team to the preregistration as collaborators.
7. Pick a license type. (Recommend CC-By)
8. Fill in the blanks and let her rip!

## **Sharing as Public Protocol**

<aside>
➕ **Pros:** Does not imply the same level of commitment as a pre-registration, but does look more professional than the shared GoogleDoc. Can be referenced by the OSF project’s DOI.

<aside>
➖ **Cons:** If students later decide they do not want to be associated with the project, the public protocol cannot as easily be taken down. Does not have it’s own DOI.

Examples: [https://osf.io/d8ewm/](https://osf.io/d8ewm/) [https://osf.io/zcrju/](https://osf.io/zcrju/)

1. Create an OSF account on [http://osf.io/](http://osf.io/)
2. Ask your team to all join OSF and tell you their names.
3. Create a new project.
4. Invite your team to the project as collaborators.
5. Upload the file (word document or pdf) of your finished protocol to the project. You can do this under ‘Files’ and make a new folder. You do *not* need to create a new component for the protocol.
6. Make the project public.
7. Once your project is public, select the option to create a DOI at the top left of the window (near the project title).
8. Celebrate!

## Sharing as a **Time-stamped Public Protocol on GoogleDocs**

<aside>
➕ **Pros:** Does not imply the same level of commitment as a public protocol or pre-registration. If students later decide they do not want to be associated with the project, the protocol can simply be taken down. Protocols or pre-registrations on OSF cannot easily be taken down.

</aside>

<aside>
➖ **Cons:** Does not offer a DOI and looks slightly less professional than a pre-registration using a website like OSF.
